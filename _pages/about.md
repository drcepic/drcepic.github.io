<p align='justify'>
Through metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics, I aim to understand how gut and skin microbiota impacts health, particularly in the context of infection and inflammation.

## The Research:

### • Influence of the Host Genetics on Gut Microbiota Dynamics, Antibiotic Response, and Colonization Resistance

<p align='justify; style="text-indent: 25px'>
The gut microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms, plays an important roles in nutrient metabolism, immune development, and pathogen defense. Differential expression of the <em>B4galnt2</em> gene influences these microbial communities, affecting host susceptibility to infections such as <em>Salmonella</em> Typhimurium. This research explores how <em>B4galnt2</em> expression impacts gut microbiota dynamics, particularly after antibiotic treatment and during infection, using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our findings reveal that <em>B4galnt2</em>-deficient mice exhibit faster microbiota recovery post-antibiotic treatment and greater resistance to pathogen colonization, with beneficial microbes like <em>Blautia</em> and <em>Akkermansia muciniphila</em> being enriched. Additionally, specific microbial profiles associated with <em>B4galnt2</em> alleles correlate with reduced inflammation and enhanced intestinal homeostasis. These results highlight the role of <em>B4galnt2</em> in shaping microbial diversity, recovery, and resistance to intestinal pathogens.

### • Microbiota-specific T cell responses in pemphigoid diseases [CRC 1526: B08](https://www.sfb1526.uni-luebeck.de/research/research-area-b/project-b08.html)

<p align='justify'>  
This project focuses on interplay between the skin microbiota and immune responses, particularly in Bullous Pemphigoid (BP). In this research we explore how alterations in skin microbial communities contribute to disease initiation and severity, with a specific focus on T cell-mediated immunity. Distinct microbial profiles have been identified in patients compared to controls, with notable differences between lesional and non-lesional sites. These microbiota shifts are analyzed for their potential role in immune dysregulation, particularly their influence on T cell-mediated responses. Using advanced sequencing and microbial profiling techniques, we examine key indicator species, such as <em>Staphylococcus</em> and <em>Corynebacterium</em>, to uncover mechanisms driving disease pathology. The work seeks to provide insights into BP pathogenesis and to support the development of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
