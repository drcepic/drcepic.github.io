I am a microbiome researcher in the [Evolutionary Genomics group](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/evolgenomics/) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and the IEM (Kiel University), investigating gut and skin microbial dynamics and pathogen resistance.

Through metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics, I aim to understand how gut and skin microbiota impacts health, particularly in the context of infection and inflammation.
